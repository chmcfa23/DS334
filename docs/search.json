Tuberculosis (or TB) is a disease of the respiratory tract, and one of our oldest biological “companions.” With all the time we have spent together, TB has had many millennia to foil every attempt we make at preventing, diagnosing, and treating it- a fight that continues to this day.\nStreptomycin is our “old faithful” of pharmaceutical antibiotics, and the go-to for most bacterial infections. But tuberculosis is no common cold, and across the 80 since streptomycin’s discovery, it has already managed to develop strains resistant to old faithful.\nWorking with the R package “medicaldata,” I was delighted to find that it contained a dataset that deals with this exact relationship called “strep_tb”.\nThe code for loading this data in is shown below:\n\n#install.packages(\"medicaldata\")\nstrep_tb &lt;- medicaldata::strep_tb\n\nThere are 13 variables in this dataset and 107 cases, each representing one patient hospitilized with tuberculosis. It is divided into two groups in the “arm” column- a ‘control’ group that did not recieve streptomycin and a ‘streptomycin’ group that did.\nHere is a sample of the data:\n\nhead(strep_tb)\n\n  patient_id     arm dose_strep_g dose_PAS_g gender baseline_condition\n1       0001 Control            0          0      M             1_Good\n2       0002 Control            0          0      F             1_Good\n3       0003 Control            0          0      F             1_Good\n4       0004 Control            0          0      M             1_Good\n5       0005 Control            0          0      F             1_Good\n6       0006 Control            0          0      M             1_Good\n  baseline_temp baseline_esr baseline_cavitation strep_resistance\n1    1_98-98.9F      2_11-20                 yes       1_sens_0-8\n2  3_100-100.9F      2_11-20                  no       1_sens_0-8\n3    1_98-98.9F      3_21-50                  no       1_sens_0-8\n4    1_98-98.9F      3_21-50                  no       1_sens_0-8\n5    2_99-99.9F      3_21-50                  no       1_sens_0-8\n6  3_100-100.9F      3_21-50                  no       1_sens_0-8\n               radiologic_6m rad_num improved\n1 6_Considerable_improvement       6     TRUE\n2     5_Moderate_improvement       5     TRUE\n3     5_Moderate_improvement       5     TRUE\n4     5_Moderate_improvement       5     TRUE\n5     5_Moderate_improvement       5     TRUE\n6 6_Considerable_improvement       6     TRUE\n\n\nOther variables that I am interested in: “improved,” which is whether the patient improved at the end of the study; “rad_num,” which is the degree to which a patient recovered (1 being death and 6 being considerable improvement); and “baseline_condition,” which describes how poorly the patient was doing at the start of the experiment.\nMy main question is how streptomycin affected these recovery variables.\nTo prepare this dataset for answering this question, I want to first create a new, numeric variable for the patients’ baseline condition, so I can compare it to the already existing post-treatment condition.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nstrep_tb &lt;- strep_tb %&gt;%\n  mutate(base_num = case_when(baseline_condition == \"1_Good\" ~ 3,\n                             baseline_condition == \"2_Fair\" ~ 2,\n                             baseline_condition == \"3_Poor\" ~ 1)\n         )\n\nAnalyses\nNow, I want to see if a patient’s baseline condition appears to have any correlation with the degree to which they improved. This I can do with a simple scatterplot. Because there are only a few whole numbers, I am going to use geom_jitter instead of geom_point.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data = strep_tb, aes(x = base_num, y = rad_num)) +\n  geom_jitter()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, that looks kind of weird and not very helpful. Maybe if I facet it by streptomycin treatment, it will make a little more sense.\n\nggplot(data = strep_tb, aes(x = base_num, y = rad_num)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, height = 0.15) +\n  facet_wrap(~arm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to facetting, I also drastically decreased the amount of jitter to lessen the impression that the data are not integers, and to make the relationship a little more clear. It’s still not a “good” visualization, but for the data I’m working with, it’s something.\nHere we can see that yes, there is some relationship between a patient’s baseline condition and how drastically they improved after the study. The better their starting condition (increasing from 1), the greater the degree to which they improved (rad_num, with 1 being death and 6 being considerable recovery).\nAdditionally, we see that when treated with streptomycin, fewer people died (had a rad_num of 1) and more people experienced greater recovery.\nNow that a relationship between pre and post-treatment condition has been established, I am more comfortable answering my original question: “What effect does streptomycin have on the degree of recovery?”\nFor this, a simple facetted histogram would be the best option for visuualization.\n\nggplot(data = strep_tb, aes(x = rad_num)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~arm)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is a kind of ugly graph. The bars are too thin, making the data look disconnected, and the x-axis both 1) doesn’t have a very descriptive label and 2) does not show the odd numbers.\nSo I think I’ll fix it.\n\nggplot(data = strep_tb, aes(x = rad_num)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"black\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"TB Patient Recovery With and Without Streptomycin\", \n       x = \"Radiologic Number\",\n       caption = \"*Radiologic Number represents the degree to which patients recovered after the experiment, with 6 \\n indicating 'Considerable Improvement,' and 1  indicating that the patient passed away\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,1)) +\n  facet_wrap(~arm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the final graph, I made the x-axis prettier and more useful, bulked up the bars, and added a nice little caption and a title that should help to provide context.\nConclusion\nI think I definitely could have picked a better dataset for this blog, there wasn’t much variety in the variables in terms of type (numeric, categorical, etc…) and in the actual levels (eg. there only being 6 possible values for the recovery degrees.) But given what I had, I think I generated two decent graphs.\nIf I had more time to find a dataset, I probably would have looked for something with less “subjectivity”, like vital statistics, time in hospital, age and sex information, etc… But you win some and lose some\nConnection to Class Ideas\nI tried to be creative and use stuff we learned in class. I made a point to use dplyr to create that Baseline Condition variable (because for some reason they didn’t think to include a purely numeric variable for that like they did with the “radiologic_6m” one??) And I tried to show off two graphs, one with two quantitatives and one with a mix. If there were more categorical variables, I would have liked to do a barplot or something.
